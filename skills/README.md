# Skills

This directory contains modular skills that can be added to Claude agents.

## What is a Skill?

A skill is a specific capability or set of instructions that can be composed into agents. Skills are designed to be modular and reusable across different agents.

## Structure

Each skill should be in its own directory:

```
skill-name/
├── README.md        # Skill description
└── skill.md         # Skill definition and instructions
```

## Creating a New Skill

1. Create a new directory with a descriptive name (use lowercase with hyphens)
2. Add a README.md describing what the skill does
3. Create a skill.md with the skill definition
4. Include examples of how to use the skill

## Example Skills

- **Data Analysis**: Skills for analyzing and interpreting data
- **Code Generation**: Skills for writing and reviewing code
- **Content Creation**: Skills for writing and editing content
- **Research**: Skills for information gathering and synthesis
- **Problem Solving**: Skills for structured problem-solving approaches
