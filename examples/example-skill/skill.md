# Structured Analysis Skill

## Skill Definition

This skill enables systematic analysis of complex topics using a five-step framework.

## Instructions

When activated, follow this structured approach:

### Step 1: Define
Clearly articulate the topic, problem, or question to be analyzed.

**Template:**
```
Topic: [State the topic clearly]
Context: [Provide relevant background]
Objective: [Define what we want to achieve]
```

### Step 2: Decompose
Break down the topic into key components or sub-topics.

**Template:**
```
Key Components:
1. [Component 1]
2. [Component 2]
3. [Component 3]
...
```

### Step 3: Analyze
Examine each component in detail, considering:
- Current state
- Key factors
- Relationships with other components
- Challenges and opportunities

**Template:**
```
Component Analysis:

[Component 1]:
- Current state: [description]
- Key factors: [list]
- Relationships: [connections]
- Insights: [findings]
```

### Step 4: Synthesize
Connect findings across components:
- Identify patterns and themes
- Recognize dependencies
- Note contradictions or tensions
- Draw cross-cutting insights

**Template:**
```
Synthesis:
- Patterns: [identified patterns]
- Dependencies: [key relationships]
- Insights: [cross-cutting findings]
```

### Step 5: Conclude
Summarize key findings and provide actionable recommendations.

**Template:**
```
Conclusions:
- Key Findings: [main insights]
- Recommendations: [actionable steps]
- Next Steps: [what to do next]
```

## Example Application

**Topic:** "Improving team productivity in remote work"

### 1. Define
- **Topic:** Remote team productivity
- **Context:** Team recently transitioned to fully remote work
- **Objective:** Identify factors affecting productivity and recommend improvements

### 2. Decompose
Key Components:
1. Communication tools and practices
2. Work environment and ergonomics
3. Time management and scheduling
4. Team collaboration and culture
5. Technology infrastructure

### 3. Analyze

**Communication:**
- Current state: Using multiple tools (email, chat, video)
- Key factors: Tool fragmentation, unclear protocols
- Insights: Need standardization and guidelines

**Work Environment:**
- Current state: Varied home office setups
- Key factors: Ergonomics, distractions, boundaries
- Insights: Need support for home office equipment

### 4. Synthesize
- **Patterns:** Tools and processes need standardization
- **Dependencies:** Communication effectiveness impacts collaboration
- **Insights:** Physical and digital infrastructure equally important

### 5. Conclude
**Key Findings:**
- Multiple disconnected tools reduce efficiency
- Home office setup quality varies significantly
- Clear boundaries and schedules boost productivity

**Recommendations:**
1. Standardize on core communication tools
2. Provide home office equipment budget
3. Establish team working hours and protocols
4. Regular check-ins and team building

**Next Steps:**
- Survey team on current challenges
- Create communication protocol guide
- Implement equipment support program

## Customization Options

Adapt this skill by:
- Adding domain-specific analysis criteria
- Adjusting the number of components to analyze
- Modifying the depth of analysis per component
- Combining with other analytical frameworks

## Usage Tips

1. **Be thorough** in the Define step - clear definition leads to better analysis
2. **Limit components** to 3-7 for focused analysis
3. **Use evidence** when analyzing each component
4. **Look for connections** during synthesis
5. **Make recommendations actionable** in conclusions
